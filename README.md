# bayesian_models
This repository contains projects that demonstrate my Bayesian modeling skills. Each folder contains the data, R code, LaTex file to generate the report, and the final pdf report. The projects in each folder are described below.

**logistic_regression**

This project evaluates the theory that countries that are more concerned with gender equality are also more concerned with the wellbeing of their country in general, and therefore more likely to exert higher levels of concern for environmental wellbeing. Bayesian logistic regression models are used to test this theory. This project was completed for a graduate-level Bayesian models class.

**hierarchical_regression**

*This was my master's project, required for MStat graduation.* 

I use a Bayesian hierarchical regression model to test whether poor measures of health outcomes are associated with higher levels of subordination of women. The Bayesian hierarchical regression model is proposed over using multivariate or simple regression analyses because of 1) the non-random missingness in the data, and 2) the relationship between the health outcomes. Before implementing the proposed Bayesian hierarchical regression model, I use a simulation study to test it against these other models. I find that overall the Bayesian hierarchical model tends to estimate with less bias and more accuracy than the other models. Using the hierarchical model, I find that higher levels of subordination of women in the household are significantly and consistently associated with worse health outcomes for women and children, and that while the results are less consistent for overall health, that the same relationship exists in most of those models.
